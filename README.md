# E-Commerce-Website-Analysis
## Introduction
In this analysis, I have examined an e-commerce platform akin to Amazon or Flipkart, focusing on aspects such as customer expectations, product performance, website sales, and more. The analysis encompasses seven key tables: Products, Categories, Orders, Order Details, Reviews, Shipping, Coupons, Discounts, and Customers.
